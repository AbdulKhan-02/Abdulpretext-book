                        <statement>
                            <p>This is an example of an example with a bit more structure.  Specifically, the example has a <c>title</c>, as usual, but then has a <c>statement</c>, which is separate from the <c>solution</c>.  Why did we implement an example in two ways?</p>
                        </statement>
                        <solution>
                            <p>Authors asked for it and it seemed a very natural thing to do, even if we only had an unstructured version for a long time.</p>
                        </solution>
