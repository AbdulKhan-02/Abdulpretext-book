                        <title>Sample Use of Sage</title>

                        <p>This would be a good place to talk about Sage, including a cell or two.</p>

                        <sage>
                            <input>diff(x^4, x)</input>
                            <output>4*x^3</output>
                        </sage>

                        <p>But you might want to describe how to use some other calculator, or maybe some numerical method.</p>
