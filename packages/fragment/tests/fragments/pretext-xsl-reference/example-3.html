    This is an example of an example with a bit more structure. Specifically,
    the example has a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">title</code>, as
    usual, but then has a
    <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">statement</code>, which is separate
    from the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">solution</code>. Why did
    we implement an example in two ways?

      Authors asked for it and it seemed a very natural thing to do, even if we
      only had an unstructured version for a long time.
