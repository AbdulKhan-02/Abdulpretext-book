    The problem with writing a book in verse is, to be successful, it has to
    sound like you knocked it off on a rainy Friday afternoon. It has to sound
    easy. When you can do it, it helps tremendously because it’s a thing that
    forces kids to read on. You have this unconsummated feeling if you stop.
